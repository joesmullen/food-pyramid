# 🍎 food pyramid

This is the first, and best, assignment I had to complete for CS130 (Web Information Processing) -
an interactive food pyramid made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

# 🍛 features

- Record daily food intake, sorted by category (e.g. fruit and vegetables, represented in green)
- Adjusts height of each section of the pyramid, according to corresponding serving sizes
- Displays serving sizes in maroon when going over the recommended daily amount
- Change between serving suggestions for ages 1-4 and ages 5+
- Enter, validate, and display today's date underneath the pyramid (any other date won't work)
- Optimised for mobile using CSS media queries

# 🤔 development & reflection

I already had some decent knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript prior to this assignment from some 
books my friend had given me, so it was great to finally work on a project where I could 
incorporate all three and further improve my skills. I learned how to make shapes with CSS, and I 
really enjoyed using JavaScript's template literals to incorporate variables into strings, as well 
as using the ternary operator more instead of simple if/else statements.

I received a grade of **85%** for this assignment, which was worth 5% of the overall module. I did 
all of the extra credit options as well, which were worth an additional 5%, but I don't think I got 
graded for them because I didn't know they had to be uploaded separately. 🙃
