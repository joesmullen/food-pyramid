# üçé food pyramid

This is the first, and best, assignment I had to complete for CS130 (Web Information Processing). 

I created an interactive food pyramid where users can record how many servings of a given food 
category they've eaten today (e.g. fruit and veg, represented in green), and thus see if they've 
eaten too few or too many servings of those foods. The user can also switch between the serving 
suggestions for ages 1-4 and ages 5+, as well as enter today's date and display it below the 
pyramid, provided it's entered correctly. The serving suggestions were based on [Irish government 
guidelines](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/70a2e4-the-food-pyramid/). The heights of each
section of the pyramid also change depending on the amount of servings for the corresponding
food category.

I already had some decent knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript prior to this assignment from some 
books my friend had given me, so it was great to finally work on a project where I could 
incorporate all three and further improve my skills. I learned how to make shapes with CSS, and I 
really enjoyed using JavaScript's template literals to incorporate variables into strings, as well 
as using the ternary operator more instead of simple if/else statements.

I received a grade of 85% for this assignment. I did all of the extra credit options as well, but I
don't think I got graded for them because I didn't know they had to be uploaded separately. üôÉ
